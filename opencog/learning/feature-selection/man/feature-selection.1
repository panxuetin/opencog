.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Options fall into three classes: options for controlling input and
output, options for controlling the algorithm behaviour, and general
options.

.SS "General options"
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print command options and exit.
.TP
.BI \-j\  num \fR,\ \fB\-\-jobs= num
Allocate \fInum\fR threads for feature selection.  Using multiple
threads on multi-core processors will speed the feature selection
search.

.TP
.B -\-version
Print program version, and exit.

.PP
.\" ============================================================
.SS "Input and output control options"
These options control how the input and output is managed by the
program.

.TP
.BI \-F\  filename \fR,\ \fB\-\-log\-file= filename
Write debug log traces \fIfilename\fR. If not specified, traces
are written to \fBfeature-selection.log\fR.
.TP
.BI \-i\  filename \fR,\ \fB\-\-input\-file= filename
The \fIfilename\fR specifies the input data file. The input table must
be in 'delimiter\-separated value' (DSV) format.  Valid seperators
are comma (CSV, or comma-separated values), blanks and tabs
(whitespace). Columns correspond to features; there is one sample per
(non-blank) row. Comment characters are hash, bang and semicolon (#!;)
lines starting with a comment are ignored.
The \fB\-i\fR flag may be specified multiple times, to indicate multiple
input files. All files must have the same number of columns.
.TP
.BI \-L\fR,\ \fB\-\-log\-file\-dep\-opt
Write debug log traces to a filename constructed from the passed
option flags and values. The filename will be truncated to a maximum
of 255 characters.
.TP
.BI \-l\  loglevel \fR,\ \fB\-\-log\-level= loglevel
Specify the level of detail for debug loging. Possible
values for \fIloglevel\fR are \fBNONE\fR, \fBERROR\fR, \fBWARN\fR,
\fBINFO\fR, \fBDEBUG\fR, and \fBFINE\fR. Case does not matter.
Caution: excessive logging detail can lead to program slowdown.
.TP
.BI \-o\  filename \fR,\ \fB\-\-output\-file= filename
Write results to \fIfilename\fR. If not specified, results are written
to \fBstdout\fR.
.TP
.BI \-u\  label \fR,\ \fB\-\-target\-feature= label
The \fIlabel\fR is used as the target feature to fit.  If none is
specified, then the first column is used.  The very first row of the
input file, if it contains non-numeric, non-boolean values, is
interpreted as column labels, as is the common practice for
CSV/DSV file formats.
.PP
.\" ============================================================
.SS "Algorithm control options"
These options provide overall control over the algorithm execution.
The most important of these, for controlling behaviour, are the
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-f\fR and \fB\-r\fR flags.

.TP
.BI \-a\  algorithm \fR,\ \fB\-\-algo= algorithm
Select the algorithm to use for feature selection.
Available algorithms include:
.TS
tab (@);
l lx.
\fBhc\fR@T{
Hillclimbing. 
T}
\fBinc\fR@T{
Incremental.

Must specify either the \fB\-C\fP or the \fB\-T\fP flag, as otherwise,
all features will be selected.
T}
.TE
.TP
.BI \-C\  num_features \fR,\ \fB\-\-inc\-target\-size= num_features
Attempt to select \fInum_features\fR out of the total available set.
This option is ignored unless the chosen algorithm is \fBinc\fP.

.TP
.BI \-r\  seed \fR,\ \fB\-\-random\-seed= seed
Use \fIseed\fR as the seed value for the pseudo-random number generator.

.TP
.BI \-T\  pressure \fR,\ \fB\-\-inc\-intenisty= pressure
Apply a selection pressure to the features being choosen. This should
specify a floating-point value between zero and one. A value of zero
means that probably all features will be selected; a value of one means
that probably no features will be selected.

This option is ignored unless the chosen algorithm is \fBinc\fP.
