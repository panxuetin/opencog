This directory currently contains four subdirectories:

-- moses -- contains the code for the "meta-optimizing semantic
   evolutionary search" algorithm, used in several places inside
   opencog.  MOSES is able to perform regression, learning a combo
   program from an input table. See the opencog wiki for more
   information and documentation.

-- feature selection -- code that makes use of moses.

-- dimensionalembedding -- code that makes use of moses.
