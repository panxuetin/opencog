= Dimensional Embedding

This implements a method of dimensional embedding of the atomspace
using the Harel-Koren algorithm as described on

http://wiki.opencog.org/w/OpenCogPrime:WikiBook#Dimensional_Embedding and
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.20.5390

k-nearest neighbour queries are answered quickly using the following
cover tree implementation:

== Using DimEmbedModule in Scheme

To embed an atomspace using a certain link type and number of dimensions
(eg similarity link, 50 dimensions)...

	(embedSpace 'SimilarityLink 50)

To find the k nearest neighbors of a node...

	(kNN node linkType k)

eg to find 10 similar things to the "dog" concept node...

	(kNN (cog-node 'ConceptNode "dog") 'SimilarityLink 10)

Note that the atomspace must already be embedded (via embedSpace) for
the given link type before you can find the k nearest neighbours for
any nodes.

The entire embedding (the list of pivots and each node's embedding
vector) can be written to the cogserver log using

	(logEmbedding LinkType)
	
== About Complexity
> It uses dijkstra's algorithm on the whole atomspace once for each
> pivot, so it should run in O(D*(|E| + |V|log|V|)) time, where E is the
> number of links, V is the number of nodes, and D is the number of
> dimensions (pivots). Based on experiments with random datasets, this
> seems accurate (specific times from my 2008 laptop):
>
> For embedding in 50 dimensions:
>
> 1,000 nodes 4000  links - 21 seconds
> 1,000 nodes 8000  links - 41 seconds
> 1,000 nodes 12000 links - 63 seconds
>
> 3,000 nodes 9000 links - 54 seconds
> 3,000 nodes 18000 links - 114 seconds
> 3,000 nodes 24000 links - 155 seconds
>
> 10,000 nodes 30,000 links - 246 seconds
> 10,000 nodes 60,000 links - 415 seconds
> 10,000 nodes 90,000 links - 585 seconds
>
> The amount of time for each pivot was consistent for any given
> embedding (ie the first 10 pivots took the same amount of time to pick
> as the last 10).
> The thesaurus data had 6k nodes and 500k links and that took about
> 3000 seconds (50 minutes, 1 minute per pivot), which seems pretty
> consistent with the random datasets/big-O-predicted complexity.

algorithm.
