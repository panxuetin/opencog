    ---------------------------------------------------------------

Subdirectories contain assorted notes and data used to make coding
and design decisions.  These are raw notes and data.  They are not going
to be explained in any sort of greater detail than what can already be
found within them.  They are meant to be a record of the research, so as
to assist future verification or regression testing, etc.
