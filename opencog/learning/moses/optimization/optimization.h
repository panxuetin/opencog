 * information_theoretic_bits -- return information content of the field set.
 *
 * The information content of a single variable is defined as log base
 * two of the number of possible values that the variable can take.
 * Thus, for example, a single bit has two possible values, and an
 * information content of exactly one.
 *
 * The information-theoretic content of a contin variable is log_2(5).
 * This is because there are five ways to alter a contin: twiddle the
 * least-significant pseudo-bit (2 choices: L,R), erase the least
 * significant bit (1 choice), add a new least-significant bit
 * (2 choices: L,R).
 *
 * This routine sums the total information content in a field set,
 * including that in contin and term fields, as well as the discrete
 * and boolean fields.
 *
 * This is usually a good estimate for the total number of nearest
 * neighbors of an instance, rarely differing by more than twenty
 * percent. This is because the nearest neighbors of an instance are
 * those that differ by a Hamming distance of one, and the total
 * length of the instance is approximately equal to info-theo-bits!

/**
 * Hill Climbing: search the local neighborhood of an instance for the
 * highest score, move to that spot, and repeat until no further
 * improvment is possible.
 *
 * This optimizatin algo performs an exhaustive search of the local
 * neighborhood centered upon a specific instance. The search is
 * normally limited to the neighborhood at Hamming distance=1 from the
 * central instance. The point with the best score (the "highest point")
 * is declared the new center, and the exhaustive search of the nearest
 * neighbors is repeated.  This loop is repeated until no further
 * improvement is possible.
 *
 * The number of nearest neighbors is roughly equal to the number of
 * knobs in the exemplar, and, more precisely, to the information-
 * theoretic bit length of the field set.
 *
 * The operation of this algorithm is modified in several important
 * ways. If the number of nearest neighbors exceeeds a significant
 * fraction of the max-allowed scoring function evaluations, then the
 * nearest neighborhood is sub-sampled, instead of being exhaustively
 * searched.
 *
 * If the single_step flag is set, then the search will terminate if
 * a higher-scoring instance is found.  Since the search is made only
 * to distance=1, using this flag is silly, unless the widen_search
 * flag is also used, which will cause the algo to search increasingly
 * larger neighborhoods.  In this case, the algo stops when improvement
 * is seen, or all neighborhoods up to the maximum distance have been
 * explored.
 *
 * In call cases, the neighborhood searched is 'spherical'; that is,
 * only the instances that are equi-distant from the exemplar are
 * explored (i.e. at the same Hamming distance).
 *
 * NB: most problems seem to do just fine without the single-step,
 * broaden-search flag combination.  However, some problems, esp. those
 * with a deceptive scoring function (e.g. polynomial factoring, -Hsr)
 * seem to work better with -L1 -T1 -I0.

/**
 * Star-shaped search: Apply a modified smulated annealing-style search.

 * compatibility, for the moment.
 *
 * The search pattern used is similar to the -L1 -T1 -I0 variant of
 * hill-climbing, except that, instead of always searching the nearest
 * neighbors, it occasionally broadens the search to a larger
 * neighborhood, looking at more distant neighbors (thus the name "star
 * shape", as the common term for such non-convex sets in mathematics).
 * The fraction of more distant neighbors explored is determined by a
 * temperature parameter, thus the allusion to annealing. In addition,
 * the same temperature is also used to keep eithr the new best instance,
 * or the old one.  Why these two different, unrelated things should ever
 * have the same temperature is one of the reasons the implementation
 * below is broken/deprecated.
 *
 * A "true" simulated-annealing algo would have worked like this:
 * a) Explore the nearest-neighborhood of a "center instance".
 * b) Using a Boltzmann distribution, select either the highest scroring
 *    instance, or one of the next-best few, as the new center instance.
 * c) Goto step a).
 * but that's NOT AT ALL what this algo does.
