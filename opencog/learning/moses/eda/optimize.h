    // Generic evolutionary competition algorithm, intended for use
    // with algorithms that can discern dependencies between the effects
    // of "genes" within the population (i.e. intended for use with 
    // estimation-of-distribution algorithms, such as the Bayesian 
    // optimization algorithm, but can also be used with "dumb"
    // algorithms). For MOSES, "gene" is a synonym for "knob", 
    // "variable" or "field".
    //
    // Rough outline: an initial population of individuals is created
    // and scored.  Then, up to max_gen iterations are performed, or
    // until the TerminationPolicy is satisfied, whichever is less.
    // Uses SelectionPolicy to select n_select individuals out of the 
    // population. Typical policies would select the fittest individuals.
    // The selected individuals are then used to create a "structure
    // model" and a "probability model".  The structure model building
    // step is meant to discover any inter-dependencies between the
    // "genes" in the model (aka the variables, fields).  The 
    // probability model-building step is meant to discern the actual
    // distribution of the fittest instances in the selected population.
    // After modelling, the model is used to create n_generate new
    // individuals.  These new individuals are scored for fitness using
    // the ScoringPolicy.  Finally, the ReplacementPolicy is used to
    // fold these new individuals into the populatin, and then the
    // iteration loop repeats.
    //
    // So, again:
    // n_select: number of individuals to select out of the population,
    //     and enroll into the model-building steps.  The SelectionPolicy
    //     will be  used to select this many, each generation.
    // n_generate: the number of new individuals to generate, after
    //     modelling.
    //
    // Returns the number of scoring function evaluations actually
    // performed.
    //
    // Note that the scoring function must be THREAD-SAFE.  This routine
    // will launch multiple threads to perform scoring, but it will use
    // only a single instance of the scoring function to do so. Thus,
    // if the scoring function is implemented as an object, and is
    // maintaining internal state, it must do so in a thread-safe manner.
