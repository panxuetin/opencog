// Demonstration program for the "max" optimization problem, for
// continuous variables.  This is a variation of the standard
// onemax/nmax demonstraton problems. Here, a scoring function is
// used that sums the squares of the values of a set of discrete
// variables.  This is the "sphere" scoring function.  The optimizer is
// supposed to be able to find the best solution to this function:
// namely, all of the variables should be zero.  Although finding a
// solution is trivial if one applies a bit of calculus, it becomes
// a bit tricker for evoilutionary algorithms, primarily because the
// need to handle continuously-valued variables makes the size of the
// search space uncountable (cardinality of the continuum), and because
// evolutionary algorithms typically do not track derivatives (which
// is how the problem becomes easy when applying calculus).
//
// XXX Currently, this doesn't really work well, or maybe at all, in
// part because the contin implementation in the field set is incomplete
// or broken or maybe both; there is a confusion between depth and arity
// in that code. (i.e. confusion between depth and breadth, between arity
// and log_2(arity), etc.) See
// https://bugs.launchpad.net/opencog/+bug/908247
//
// NOTE: This is NOT a demonstration of program learning, which is what
// MOSES is designed for; rather, this a demonstration of the use of a
// certain component within MOSES, the so-called "optimizer". MOSES itself
// relies heavily on this optimizer to implement its meta-optimization
// algorithm.
//
// This program requires five arguments:
// -- an initial seed value for the random number generator
// -- the number of contin variables
// -- the population size
// -- the maximum number of generations to run.
// -- the number that is -log_2(epsilon) where epsilon is the smallest
//    distinction between continuous variables what will be drawn.
//
// XXX todo -- finish documentation to make it look more like the
// onemax/nmax example programs.
