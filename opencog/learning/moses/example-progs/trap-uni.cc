// Demonstration program for the "univariate trap" optimization problem.
// This is a standard learning/optimization demonstraton problem: a 
// scoring function is given that surrounds the correct solution with
// nearby solutions which are given a very low score.  This is related
// to the "nmax" problem, except for having a vee-shaped scoring function.
// The vee-shape is meant to be "deceptive", in that it fools ordinary
// GA or hill-climbing solvers into loking for a solution in the wrong
// place (i.e. on the wrong side of the vee -- the vee isolates the 
// singular, unique global maximum by a valley on all sides, which is
// densely surrounded by exponentially many local but inferior maxima.)
//
// As such problems go, this turns out to be "deceptively" easy for
// the moses univariate optimizer to solve. This is because it has been
// constructed to treat each possible value of a variable as independent,
// and analyzing probability distributions for these.  Thus, the
// optimizer doesn't perceive the "vee" shape in the scoring function.
// It is able to solve this problem at exactly the same efficiency as the
// nmax problem.  The code here just illustrates this.
//
// NOTE: This is NOT a demonstration of program learning, which is what
// MOSES is designed for; rather, this a demonstration of the use of a
// certain component within MOSES, the so-called "optimizer". MOSES itself
// relies heavily on this optimizer to implement its meta-optimization
// algorithm.
//
//
// This program requires five arguments:
// -- an initial seed value for the random number generator
// -- the number of discrete variables
// -- the population size
// -- the maximum number of generations to run.
// -- the number of values that variables may take.
//
// Suggest values of 0 8 70 100 5 for these.
//
// The population size should always be at least (n-1)*num_variables
// as otherwise, the least-fit individuals will be bred out of
// the population before the fittest individual is found, causing the
// algo loop forever (well, only up to max generations). There's even
// some risk of this when the population is only a little larger than
// this lower bound; maybe one-n-a-half or twice this lower bound would
// be a good choice.
//
// As output, this will print the fittest individual found at each
// generation. At the conclusion, the entire population will be printed.

// Return, as the score, the trap function. The trap has a V-shape,
// giving highest score for bit strings with all bits set, 
// -----------------------------------------------------------

// Trap scoring function.
// The per-variable scoring function is implemented in "vee()".
// The operator() function computes the score for a given instance.
