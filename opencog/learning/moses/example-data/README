               Example Data Sets
               -----------------

This directory contains several example data sets that moses can
process.  A header in each file explains what is contained therein,
and how to run moses for that dataset.

In order of increasing complexity and sophistication:

disjunction.csv     -- a very very simple example.
column-labels.csv   -- using column labels
predicates.csv      -- learning arithmetic predicates.
bank.csv            -- learning a score from boolean variables.
