; Example data file illustrating table-based regression in MOSES.
;
; Data consists of four columns; the last column is the "result",
; and the first three columns are the "data to fit".  In this case,
; the last column is the boolen-or of the first three.
; Thus, we expect MOSES to learn the combo program "or(#aaa #bbb #ccc)".
; where the -W1 flag is used to print the column labels.
;
; To run, enter: "moses -H it -i column_labels.csv -W1 -u or_them_all
